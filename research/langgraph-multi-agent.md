# LangGraph Multi-Agent Architecture Reference

## Overview

LangGraph provides powerful patterns for building multi-agent systems where specialized agents can collaborate to solve complex tasks. This is particularly useful for novel writing where different aspects (plot, character development, world-building, prose) require specialized expertise.

## Core Multi-Agent Architectures

### 1. Supervisor Architecture

A central "supervisor" agent coordinates and delegates tasks to specialized agents.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Central control and coordination
- Supervisor decides which agent to invoke
- Controls communication flow between agents
- Ideal for hierarchical task management

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[plot_agent, character_agent, worldbuilding_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    prompt="You manage a team of novel writing specialists. Delegate tasks based on current needs."
)
```

**Benefits for Novel Writing:**
- Ensures coherent story direction
- Maintains consistency across different story elements
- Can balance different aspects of the narrative

### 2. Swarm Architecture

Agents dynamically hand off control based on their specialization without central coordination.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Decentralized control
- Dynamic handoffs between agents
- Remembers which agent was last active
- Agents decide when to transfer control

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
swarm = create_swarm(
    agents=[dialogue_agent, description_agent, action_agent],
    default_active_agent="dialogue_agent"
)
```

**Benefits for Novel Writing:**
- Natural flow between different writing styles
- Specialized agents can take control when their expertise is needed
- More organic narrative development

## Handoff Mechanisms

### Command Object Pattern

The core mechanism for agent communication and control transfer:

```python
def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["plot_agent", "character_agent", "editor_agent"]]:
    # Analyze current state and determine next agent
    next_agent = determine_next_specialist(state)
    
    return Command(
        goto=next_agent,
        update={"current_chapter": state["chapter"], "notes": "Focus on character motivation"}
    )
```

### Handoff Characteristics

1. **State Preservation**: Agents can pass relevant context and state
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Decisions can be made at runtime based on content
3. **Hierarchical Navigation**: Agents can route to peers or supervisors
4. **Tool-based Transfers**: Agents can use tools to facilitate handoffs

## Multi-Level Supervisor Pattern for Novel Writing

### Proposed Hierarchy

```
Master Supervisor (Novel Coordinator)
├── Plot Supervisor
│   ├── Story Arc Agent
│   ├── Chapter Planning Agent
│   └── Scene Structure Agent
├── Character Supervisor
│   ├── Character Development Agent
│   ├── Dialogue Agent
│   └── Character Arc Agent
├── World-Building Supervisor
│   ├── Setting Agent
│   ├── Magic/Technology System Agent
│   └── Culture/Society Agent
└── Prose Supervisor
    ├── Description Agent
    ├── Action Sequence Agent
    └── Style Consistency Agent
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Message History**: All agents receive the overall message history
2. **Internal State**: Each agent maintains its own internal message history
3. **Output Integration**: Agent outputs are integrated into the system state

## Council Pattern for Decision Making

For critical story decisions, implement a council of agents that can:

1. **Debate**: Different agents provide perspectives from their specialization
2. **Vote**: Democratic decision-making for major plot points
3. **Critique**: Agents review each other's contributions
4. **Consensus Building**: Iterate until reaching agreement

### Example Council Implementation

```python
class StoryCouncil:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
    
    def deliberate(self, proposal):
        critiques = []
        votes = []
        
        for agent in self.agents:
            critique = agent.evaluate(proposal)
            vote = agent.vote(proposal, critiques)
            critiques.append(critique)
            votes.append(vote)
        
        return self.reach_consensus(votes, critiques)
```

## Best Practices for Novel Writing System

1. **Specialization**: Each agent should have a clear, focused role
2. **Context Management**: Maintain story bible and consistency across agents
3. **Feedback Loops**: Implement critique and revision cycles
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Multiple passes with different agent focuses
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allow for human oversight at key decision points

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation
Create specialized agents on-demand for specific story elements:
- New character introduction agents
- Specific scene type agents (battle, romance, mystery)

### 2. Memory Management
- Long-term story memory (plot points, character details)
- Short-term working memory (current scene context)
- Cross-reference system for consistency

### 3. Quality Control Pipeline
- First draft agents (creative focus)
- Revision agents (consistency, pacing)
- Final polish agents (prose quality, style)

## Integration with Story Structure

Agents should be aware of:
- Story beats and structure (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey)
- Character arcs and development
- Want vs Need framework
- Ending types and their implications

This architecture enables the creation of sophisticated, nuanced novels with the depth and consistency expected in professional fiction writing.
