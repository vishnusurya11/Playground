# The Four Types of Story Endings

## Overview

Story endings can be categorized into four fundamental types based on whether the protagonist achieves their WANT and/or their NEED. This framework provides a powerful tool for crafting emotionally resonant and thematically coherent conclusions.

## The Four Ending Types

### 1. Sweet Ending (Want + Need Achieved)

The hero gets both what they want and what they need.

**Characteristics:**
- Most satisfying but hardest to execute believably
- Often requires the want to transform to align with the need
- Common in feel-good stories and traditional fairy tales
- Can feel unrealistic if not carefully earned

**Example: Back to the Future**
- **Want**: Marty wants to return to 1985
- **Need**: To gain confidence and take control of his life
- **Result**: Returns to an improved 1985 where he's more confident

**Writing Considerations:**
- Ensure the character truly earns both achievements
- The want often needs to evolve during the story
- Works best when achieving the need enables achieving the want

### 2. Bittersweet Ending (Want Achieved, Need Not)

The character gets what they want but not what they need.

**Characteristics:**
- Creates a cautionary tale effect
- Shows the hollowness of achieving goals without growth
- Often used in tragic success stories
- Leaves audience with mixed emotions

**Example: There Will Be Blood**
- **Want**: Daniel wants to become exorbitantly wealthy
- **Need**: To connect with others and find meaning beyond wealth
- **Result**: Achieves wealth but ends up alone and miserable

**Writing Considerations:**
- The want's achievement should feel hollow
- Show the cost of ignoring the need
- Often includes a moment of realization that comes too late

### 3. Tragic/Bitter Ending (Neither Want nor Need Achieved)

The character gets neither what they want nor what they need.

**Characteristics:**
- Creates powerful cautionary tales
- Shows the consequences of fatal flaws
- Common in classical tragedies
- Leaves audience with cathartic sadness

**Example: The Godfather**
- **Want**: Initially to live a normal life, then shifts to revenge
- **Need**: To remain a good person and avoid family darkness
- **Result**: Becomes the very thing he tried to avoid, loses both normal life and soul

**Writing Considerations:**
- The character's choices directly lead to their downfall
- Often involves a point of no return
- The tragedy should feel inevitable yet preventable

### 4. Ironic/Poetic Ending (Need Achieved, Want Not)

The character gets what they need but not what they want.

**Characteristics:**
- Most common in character growth stories
- Emphasizes theme over plot
- Shows true happiness comes from internal change
- Often most realistic and relatable

**Example: It's a Wonderful Life**
- **Want**: George wants to leave Bedford Falls and see the world
- **Need**: To realize his life has meaning and value where he is
- **Result**: Never leaves but discovers his life's true worth

**Writing Considerations:**
- The need's fulfillment should feel more valuable than the want
- Often includes letting go of the want voluntarily
- Character finds peace despite external "failure"

## Deeper Analysis

### Emotional Impact by Type

1. **Sweet**: Joy, satisfaction, completion
2. **Bittersweet**: Melancholy, reflection, warning
3. **Tragic**: Sorrow, catharsis, caution
4. **Ironic**: Acceptance, wisdom, growth

### Thematic Implications

Each ending type sends different messages:

- **Sweet**: "You can have it all if you grow"
- **Bittersweet**: "Success without growth is empty"
- **Tragic**: "Refusing growth leads to destruction"
- **Ironic**: "True happiness comes from within"

## Genre Preferences

- Bittersweet for more literary romance
- Tragic rarely used except in classical adaptations

### Mystery/Thriller

- Bittersweet for noir (get answers but lose innocence)
- Sweet for cozy mysteries

### Literary Fiction
- Favors Ironic and Bittersweet
- Tragic for classical influences
- Sweet used sparingly and with nuance

### Fantasy/Sci-Fi
- Full range depending on subgenre
- Epic fantasy often Sweet or Ironic
- Dystopian often Tragic or Bittersweet

### Horror

- Bittersweet for survival horror
- Ironic for psychological horror

## Crafting Effective Endings

### Setup Requirements by Type

**For Sweet Endings:**
- Establish how need achievement enables want
- Create obstacles to both want and need
- Show character growth throughout

**For Bittersweet Endings:**
- Emphasize the cost of the want
- Show what's lost by ignoring need
- Create dramatic irony for reader

**For Tragic Endings:**
- Establish fatal flaw early
- Create opportunities for redemption (rejected)
- Build inevitable momentum

**For Ironic Endings:**

- Create satisfying moment of realization

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Unearned Sweet Endings**: Character gets everything without sufficient growth
2. **Unclear Bittersweet**: Audience unsure what was gained/lost
3. **Nihilistic Tragic**: No meaning in the tragedy
4. **Unsatisfying Ironic**: Need doesn't feel worth want's loss

## Practical Decision Framework

Ask these questions to choose your ending:

1. What is my story's core theme?
2. What message do I want readers to internalize?
3. What emotional journey do I want to create?
4. What would feel most honest to these characters?
5. What ending would resonate with my target audience?

## Hybrid and Complex Endings

Some stories feature:
- Multiple protagonists with different ending types
- Ambiguous endings leaving interpretation open
- Sequential endings (appears one type, reveals as another)
- Time-jump endings showing long-term consequences

## Cultural Considerations

- Western stories traditionally favor Sweet or Ironic
- Eastern narratives more comfortable with Bittersweet
- Modern audiences increasingly accept Tragic
- Young Adult often requires hopeful elements

## Testing Your Ending

1. Does it resolve both want and need clearly?
2. Does it feel earned based on the story?
3. Does it reinforce your theme?
4. Does it provide emotional closure?
5. Does it leave the right lasting impression?

Remember: The best ending isn't the happiest one, but the one that most truthfully completes your story's emotional and thematic journey.
