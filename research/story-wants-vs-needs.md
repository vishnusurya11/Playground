# Character Wants vs Needs Framework

## Core Concept

The Want vs Need framework is fundamental to creating compelling character-driven narratives with meaningful internal conflict and satisfying character arcs.

### Definitions

**WANT**: Something your character desires, because they believe it'll improve their happiness. This is:
- External and tangible
- Known to the character
- Unique to their situation
- What drives the plot forward

**NEED**: The lesson they need to learn to overcome their inner struggle and achieve true happiness. This is:
- Internal and transformative
- Often unknown to the character initially
- Universal and thematic
- What drives the character arc

## The Fundamental Relationship

- **Wants drive the PLOT**
- **Needs drive the CHARACTER ARC**
- The tension between them creates the INTERNAL CONFLICT

### Key Insight
"The protagonist doesn't always know what they need, but they usually know what they want. That conscious goal (the want) drives the plot. It's the unconscious goal (the need) that gets realized over the course of the story."

## The Lie Your Character Believes

Central to the Want vs Need framework is "The Lie" - a false belief that:
- Prevents the character from seeing their true need
- Motivates their misguided want
- Must be overcome for character growth
- Creates the foundation for internal conflict

### Examples of Character Lies:
- "I'm not worthy of love" (leads to wanting achievement/success instead of connection)
- "The world is against me" (leads to wanting control instead of trust)
- "I must be perfect" (leads to wanting approval instead of self-acceptance)

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Pixar's Soul
- **Want**: Joe wants to return to his body and pursue his jazz career so his life won't be meaningless
- **Need**: To appreciate that the act of living itself gives life meaning
- **The Lie**: "Life is only meaningful if you achieve your dreams"

### Example 2: Zootopia
- **Want**: Judy wants to become a bunny cop to defy prejudice and make the world a better place
- **Need**: To confront the prejudice within herself to make the world a better place
- **The Lie**: "Prejudice only exists in others, not in me"

### Example 3: Classic Literature
- **Want**: Gatsby wants to win Daisy back to recapture the past
- **Need**: To accept that the past cannot be recreated and find meaning in the present
- **The Lie**: "If I'm wealthy enough, I can have everything I desire"

## Creating Effective Want vs Need Dynamics

### 1. Make the Want Actively Harmful
The character's want should not just be "not what they need" but actively preventing them from achieving happiness:
- The want provides false comfort
- Pursuing the want deepens their problems
- Success in achieving the want would be empty

### 2. Link Want and Need Intrinsically
For maximum impact:
- The want should be a false compensation for the need
- Achieving the want should force confrontation with the need
- The journey toward the want reveals the need

### 3. Create Clear Opposition
- Want and need should pull in different directions
- Character must eventually choose between them
- The choice defines their arc's resolution

## Character Journey Patterns

### The Realization Process
1. **Pursuit**: Character actively pursues their want
2. **Obstacles**: Failures and challenges accumulate
3. **Reflection**: Character begins questioning their approach
4. **Revelation**: The true need becomes apparent
5. **Choice**: Character must decide between want and need

### Growth Moments
- Each failure at achieving the want chips away at the lie
- Supporting characters often embody or voice the need
- The midpoint often involves a false victory (want) or defeat (need)
- The dark night of the soul forces final confrontation with the truth

## Implementation in Multi-Agent System

### Agent Specializations

**Want Analysis Agent**: 
- Identifies compelling external goals
- Ensures wants are specific and achievable
- Creates obstacles to want achievement

**Need Analysis Agent**:
- Determines thematic lessons
- Identifies universal human truths
- Ensures needs oppose wants effectively

**Lie Construction Agent**:
- Creates believable false beliefs
- Links lies to character backstory
- Ensures lies justify wants

**Arc Planning Agent**:
- Maps the journey from want to need
- Plans revelation moments
- Structures the choice points

## Advanced Considerations

### Multiple Wants and Needs
Complex characters may have:
- Layered wants (immediate vs. long-term)
- Conflicting needs (safety vs. growth)
- Evolving wants as story progresses

### Subplots and Secondary Characters
- Each major character should have want/need dynamics
- Subplots can mirror or contrast main theme
- Supporting characters can represent different approaches

### Genre Considerations
- **Romance**: Want (specific person) vs Need (self-love/vulnerability)
- **Mystery**: Want (solve case) vs Need (confront personal demons)
- **Fantasy**: Want (defeat villain) vs Need (accept responsibility/power)
- **Literary**: Often inverts formula - character knows need but pursues want anyway

## Practical Application Checklist

1. ✓ Is the want external and specific?
2. ✓ Is the need internal and transformative?
3. ✓ Does the character believe a lie that justifies their want?
4. ✓ Will pursuing the want eventually reveal the need?
5. ✓ Is there a clear moment of choice between want and need?
6. ✓ Does the resolution feel earned based on the journey?
7. ✓ Does the want drive plot while need drives character growth?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Want and need are too similar** - reduces conflict
2. **Need is too obvious** - reduces journey impact
3. **Character abandons want too easily** - reduces stakes
4. **Need isn't actually needed** - reduces thematic power
5. **Want isn't wanted enough** - reduces drive

## Integration with Story Endings

The four ending types directly relate to want/need achievement:
- Sweet: Both achieved (rare but satisfying)
- Bittersweet: Want achieved, need not (cautionary)
- Tragic: Neither achieved (powerful but dark)
- Ironic: Need achieved, want not (most common in growth stories)
